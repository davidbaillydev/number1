Today, whatever our activity, we want to make it visible on all possible channels as well as on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and on the Internet with a website recognized by search engines such as Google, the objective being to make ourselves known to a wide audience.

Fortunately, many CMS platforms such as Wordpress, Wix, Shopify offer to develop a website, a free blog or an E-commerce site for a monthly subscription or yearly. This system designed and adapted to a public experienced or not experienced in web development, with limited financial capabilities, can be a good compromise.

Despite the performance of these revolutionary CMS tools, promising the construction of a website at lightning speed, it requires time and patience to arrive at a satisfactory result.

If the solution of the website created by your care can be a solution of inexpensive investment, it is still necessary to be sure that your website meets all the requirements related to an online presence that must be effective over time, not to fall into oblivion and returned to the web of websites poorly read and not listed by search engines.
